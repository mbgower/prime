Using javascript to calculate prime numbers
<p>Just getting too lazy to calculate 'larger' prime numbers in my own head, and wanted to settle an argument concerning multiples of primes. Using javascript is not an efficient way of caluclating prime numbers, but it helps me retain what little web coding skills I possess.</p>
<p>I've elected to keep the report on what numbers that aren't prime are divisible by what primes, as it helps see patterns and the onset of first use of medium sized (for my noggin) primes.</p>
